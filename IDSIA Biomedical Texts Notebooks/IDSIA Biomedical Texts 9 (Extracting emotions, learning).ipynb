   \"My first panic attack happened around February of this year. Truth is I wasn't expecting it and i didn't understand it. Before that episode, i never really understood panic attacks and paid little attention to the term even if i was familiar with it from its popular usage. I had just come out of my dad's room after having a heart-to-heart talk with him when my head started feeling woozy. I thought it was just sleep trying to claim me so i went to bed but i couldn't sleep despite feeling dizzy. My mum was in the room with me so i sat up to tell her i couldn't bring myself to sleep and that was when i noticed that i was feeling de-attached from my body. I had little control over my body movement and i called out to my mum in fear. She panicked and helped take me outside, my legs were wobbly so i kept falling down. I was scared of this whole experience because i had always prided myself on my mental control so I kept asking my mum with tears running down my face,“Mummy, Am i running mad? Am I going to die?” And she'd reply, “God forbid, I reject it. No daughter of mine is going to run mad or die”. I cannot tell why but i really felt like i was going to die and worse; if i didn't die, I'd be mad. Meanwhile, i kept trying to bring myself back together but i couldn't. I was aware of everything happening but i couldn't control it. I was aware of my body making weak movements on its own and yet, i could not control it. I was aware of my brain being unable to conjure coherent thoughts and still, i could not control it. I was aware of everything and scared shitless that i could control none of what was happening. At some point, I was trying to gain control of my mind and body so I'd stand up but that meant that I'd just lose control and fall again. It felt like I was standing at some place and just watching my body misbehave Or like my mind was my own and wasn't my own at the same time (i later learnt that this was called depersonalization). My mum called out to my dad out of fear and he came out, I kept screaming that i wanted to go to the hospital, at least i believe i had some control over my speech because there were some things i made myself say, i remember i kept telling my mum “i love you and please if i do run mad, kill me. Don't let me live like that”. That scared her more. Lol I was taken to the hospital as soon as my dad came out with his car, and when I reached, i kept asking the doctor if i was running mad but he smiled and said i wasn't, he said it was a panic attack and proceeded to inform my parents about it. At some point while i was on the hospital bed, my legs and arms started to shake rapidly and that scared the shit outta me because i knew it was a seizure or something similar to it. But then, my mind was racing to epilepsy.. lol. While this was going on, i kept scaring my mum more by repeating in a shaky and teary voice, “mummy, look. I'm shaking. Do i have epilepsy? What is happening to me??” Immediately, I was injected with sleeping drugs by the nurses and i woke up the next day with a searing headache. My parents stayed with me the whole night and i was later discharged. After dealing with my first episode, i felt it trying to come back the next few days but i read up on it and found out different ways i could control it on my own which i did. Also, my anxiety sort of went to the top after that episode. I had chest aches that would not stop and i could not sleep at night, the doctor prescribed benzodiapines and some other drugs for me which helped. I also met up with a psychologist when i left for school a month later who told me about my subconscious storing up stuff i wasn't aware of. I stopped meeting with him after some time because of the our religious differences and went on to deal with myself by myself. I also had friends around me whom i confided in and they were helpful. Most mornings, I woke up all anxious and confused, I'd call anyone and start crying over the phone for no reason. Lol. But I'm over that now. I believe that the last panic attack that happened is going to be my first and last because the experience isn't something i wanna go through again.\",\n","    \"After my first one, I thought it would never happen again. But it did and it came back with a vengeance.To be completely free, you must accept and embrace death. It is only then that you can be truly alive. -Don Miguel Ruiz - The Four AgreementsI was driving, had to pull over and get out of the car. Considered calling 911 but remembered that it's only a panic attack and I probably will not die. Having walked around the block for about 40 minutes and drunk 2 bottles of cold water, the attack subsided. This might sound crazy, but I thought my food had been laced with drugs the first three times it happened because some of the people I used to associate with are shady and casual drug users, the verdict is still out on that, but at this point I can make an infinite amount of stories about the cause of what happened because I've been exposed to a lot of experiences, some good, some damaging that I would never want to happen again. During the attack, I experienced only the following: very fast & irregular heart rate, (140-160 bpm) which I measured during the attack, slight chills and impending doom and feelings of death resulted from this as well with the former being due to the abnormal heart activity I assume. The strange part was that the first time it happened, it caused me to have a weird feeling in the back of my head on the right that felt like either a part of my brain had been numbed after the attack or there was an object lodged inside my right occipital lobe as well as persistent headaches that eventually went away after about a week or so after treatment with small doses of NSAIDS. The weird occipital lobe feeling did not go away. It seems that this feeling slowly built up and became different, it sort of evolved I would say, into something different after about a month or so, sort of like electric charges this time instead of something static and weird, it felt like electrical energy was pulsating.  This after-effect was the strongest the day I had my second panic attack about 1 month after the first one. The second attack was exactly the same, super-fast irregular heart rate with palpitations following the attack. This attack also lasted about 30 minutes. After the attack I felt a slight relieve in that I knew I had survived, didn't die again -- I was very happy about that, plus that feeling in my head was almost completely gone, it's like it dissipated with the attack. Shortly after however, the feeling of something lodged in my head became even stronger, although not painful, it was a very discomforting feeling (hope I didn't get brain damage). This was also complemented with the electrical charge feeling I described in my first attack. Then in happened again for the third time. The strange part was that after the third time the weird feeling and any feeling in the head dissipated. It seemed almost as if  I had the panic attack at the culmination of the weird head feeling (when it was at its most intense), and then BOOM, the feeling was gone after the attack subsided and luckily had not returned since. The bad part was that after this third time, I became acutely aware of my breathing and everything that had to do with my heart. I was frantically measuring it and it was always 80-100 following my third attack. This really worried me because I could feel constantly inside that something was wrong either with my breathing or my heart and finally went to see a Doctor. After visiting a primary care physician, he ordered blood work, and EKG and echo. I should note that today we are still not sure whether this is panic or heart issues, or thyroid. It seems as though it's just panic (not just but better than heart issues I suppose). I actually had another attack while I was in the office, it was really bad because I started crying (I'm not one to cry usually), but before that he noticed right away that I had dyspnea and increased heart rate, which I noticed started happening upon entering the hospital. I began to weep when he started to tell me what was wrong with me, the words intensified the panc attack. This was the first time I went to a Doctor, and it seemed that as if for the first time ever I could not control what was happening inside my body, a very bad feeling. The doctor prescribed Xanax 0.5 mg as needed and Zoloft for regular dosing. I'm not taking the Zoloft because. Just because. Happy to say that the Xanax has been a life-saver practically, I am nearly back to my normal self-again and take 0.5 - 1mg as needed, which at this point seems like everyday, not because of panic everyday but because I feel anxiety every day and I'm afraid it will turn into panic if I don't drug it :) I am aware of the terrible withdrawal effects so I started to split .5mg in half and I find it still works well, which is really good because there is a much lower potential for withdrawal at that dosage. I think I will continue to take .25 3x day, exercise & eat healthily and hopefully become stronger and wiser than I was when this is all over. Thanks for reading and hope this helps researchers or doctors or people somehow.\"\n","]\n","\n","inputs = tokenizer(texts, truncation=True, padding=True, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n","outputs = model(**inputs)\n","\n","predicted_emotions = torch.sigmoid(outputs.logits).detach().numpy() # this is wrong i think, because Sigmoid is used for binary classification methods where we only have 2 classes, while SoftMax applies to multiclass problems, we should be using softmax here\n","\n","# Print the extracted emotions\n","for text, emotions in zip(texts, predicted_emotions):\n","    print(\"Text:\", text)\n","    print(\"Extracted Emotions:\")\n","    for label, score in zip(emotion_labels, emotions):\n","        print(f\"{label}: {score}\")\n","    print()"],"metadata":{"id":"4tuKKHW-bXSj","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1686830153365,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":6872,"user":{"displayName":"Suryam Gupta","userId":"07887191304479658761"}},"outputId":"0fd21b5d-1e2b-420f-dd1c-06a19f9c5323"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Text: I'm feeling ecstatic about the upcoming vacation!\n","Extracted Emotions:\n","admiration: 0.7148534655570984\n","amusement: 0.48301729559898376\n","anger: 0.0894889235496521\n","annoyance: 0.08688930422067642\n","approval: 0.7859282493591309\n","caring: 0.7447627782821655\n","confusion: 0.18037360906600952\n","curiosity: 0.5048761963844299\n","desire: 0.6507449746131897\n","disappointment: 0.05405266210436821\n","disapproval: 0.07231107354164124\n","disgust: 0.05039765685796738\n","embarrassment: 0.06864124536514282\n","excitement: 0.9468550086021423\n","fear: 0.09136921912431717\n","gratitude: 0.7412809729576111\n","grief: 0.08592982590198517\n","joy: 0.8740706443786621\n","love: 0.4946962594985962\n","nervousness: 0.21925191581249237\n","optimism: 0.9447634816169739\n","pride: 0.7613401412963867\n","realization: 0.5529742240905762\n","relief: 0.6472389698028564\n","remorse: 0.14954791963100433\n","sadness: 0.049573205411434174\n","surprise: 0.5593506097793579\n","neutral: 0.3049614131450653\n","\n","Text: This news has left me utterly devastated.\n","Extracted Emotions:\n","admiration: 0.10155171900987625\n","amusement: 0.05753500759601593\n","anger: 0.35256609320640564\n","annoyance: 0.16249288618564606\n","approval: 0.24909503757953644\n","caring: 0.4503384828567505\n","confusion: 0.486759215593338\n","curiosity: 0.2684156894683838\n","desire: 0.29369786381721497\n","disappointment: 0.860524594783783\n","disapproval: 0.6601728796958923\n","disgust: 0.723260760307312\n","embarrassment: 0.6807429790496826\n","excitement: 0.12008289992809296\n","fear: 0.635265052318573\n","gratitude: 0.08267883956432343\n","grief: 0.9558932781219482\n","joy: 0.05216022580862045\n","love: 0.1314154863357544\n","nervousness: 0.2999715805053711\n","optimism: 0.0530155673623085\n","pride: 0.12109280377626419\n","realization: 0.6055262088775635\n","relief: 0.06787700951099396\n","remorse: 0.8801094889640808\n","sadness: 0.9400402307510376\n","surprise: 0.5266905426979065\n","neutral: 0.18438628315925598\n","\n","Text: The movie was so hilarious, it had me laughing uncontrollably.\n","Extracted Emotions:\n","admiration: 0.4173460006713867\n","amusement: 0.9606696963310242\n","anger: 0.146428644657135\n","annoyance: 0.18306703865528107\n","approval: 0.617099404335022\n","caring: 0.6236786842346191\n","confusion: 0.22611983120441437\n","curiosity: 0.6045176982879639\n","desire: 0.5281816124916077\n","disappointment: 0.08579955995082855\n","disapproval: 0.23446038365364075\n","disgust: 0.07498937845230103\n","embarrassment: 0.16565512120723724\n","excitement: 0.8955150246620178\n","fear: 0.1491117924451828\n","gratitude: 0.30766043066978455\n","grief: 0.16042694449424744\n","joy: 0.8514719605445862\n","love: 0.29957738518714905\n","nervousness: 0.28822922706604004\n","optimism: 0.39703109860420227\n","pride: 0.428011953830719\n","realization: 0.5236377716064453\n","relief: 0.518577516078949\n","remorse: 0.3846750855445862\n","sadness: 0.05600906163454056\n","surprise: 0.6706281900405884\n","neutral: 0.394111305475235\n","\n","Text: My first panic attack happened around February of this year.

What is happening to me??” Immediately, I was injected with sleeping drugs by the nurses and i woke up the next day with a searing headache. My parents stayed with me the whole night and i was later discharged. After dealing with my first episode, i felt it trying to come back the next few days but i read up on it and found out different ways i could control it on my own which i did. Also, my anxiety sort of went to the top after that episode. I had chest aches that would not stop and i could not sleep at night, the doctor prescribed benzodiapines and some other drugs for me which helped. I also met up with a psychologist when i left for school a month later who told me about my subconscious storing up stuff i wasn't aware of. I stopped meeting with him after some time because of the our religious differences and went on to deal with myself by myself. I also had friends around me whom i confided in and they were helpful. Most mornings, I woke up all anxious and confused, I'd call anyone and start crying over the phone for no reason. Lol. But I'm over that now. I believe that the last panic attack that happened is going to be my first and last because the experience isn't something i wanna go through again.\n","Extracted Emotions:\n","admiration: 0.2364044040441513\n","amusement: 0.08714408427476883\n","anger: 0.28508317470550537\n","annoyance: 0.28309816122055054\n","approval: 0.6800222992897034\n","caring: 0.6155076026916504\n","confusion: 0.8408930897712708\n","curiosity: 0.4463737905025482\n","desire: 0.5845931768417358\n","disappointment: 0.5642051696777344\n","disapproval: 0.4328535199165344\n","disgust: 0.32867431640625\n","embarrassment: 0.4812396764755249\n","excitement: 0.32452914118766785\n","fear: 0.8229563236236572\n","gratitude: 0.15382780134677887\n","grief: 0.4290239214897156\n","joy: 0.0971440002322197\n","love: 0.11783409118652344\n","nervousness: 0.7699880599975586\n","optimism: 0.1483040452003479\n","pride: 0.2199965864419937\n","realization: 0.5685186982154846\n","relief: 0.17503905296325684\n","remorse: 0.6668428778648376\n","sadness: 0.5238035321235657\n","surprise: 0.4428749680519104\n","neutral: 0.3259330093860626\n","\n","Text: After my first one, I thought it would never happen again. But it did and it came back with a vengeance.To be completely free, you must accept and embrace death. It is only then that you can be truly alive. -Don Miguel Ruiz - The Four AgreementsI was driving, had to pull over and get out of the car. Considered calling 911 but remembered that it's only a panic attack and I probably will not die. Having walked around the block for about 40 minutes and drunk 2 bottles of cold water, the attack subsided. This might sound crazy, but I thought my food had been laced with drugs the first three times it happened because some of the people I used to associate with are shady and casual drug users, the verdict is still out on that, but at this point I can make an infinite amount of stories about the cause of what happened because I've been exposed to a lot of experiences, some good, some damaging that I would never want to happen again. During the attack, I experienced only the following: very fast & irregular heart rate, (140-160 bpm) which I measured during the attack, slight chills and impending doom and feelings of death resulted from this as well with the former being due to the abnormal heart activity I assume. The strange part was that the first time it happened, it caused me to have a weird feeling in the back of my head on the right that felt like either a part of my brain had been numbed after the attack or there was an object lodged inside my right occipital lobe as well as persistent headaches that eventually went away after about a week or so after treatment with small doses of NSAIDS. The weird occipital lobe feeling did not go away. It seems that this feeling slowly built up and became different, it sort of evolved I would say, into something different after about a month or so, sort of like electric charges this time instead of something static and weird, it felt like electrical energy was pulsating.  This after-effect was the strongest the day I had my second panic attack about 1 month after the first one. The second attack was exactly the same, super-fast irregular heart rate with palpitations following the attack. This attack also lasted about 30 minutes. After the attack I felt a slight relieve in that I knew I had survived, didn't die again -- I was very happy about that, plus that feeling in my head was almost completely gone, it's like it dissipated with the attack. Shortly after however, the feeling of something lodged in my head became even stronger, although not painful, it was a very discomforting feeling (hope I didn't get brain damage). This was also complemented with the electrical charge feeling I described in my first attack. Then in happened again for the third time. The strange part was that after the third time the weird feeling and any feeling in the head dissipated. It seemed almost as if  I had the panic attack at the culmination of the weird head feeling (when it was at its most intense), and then BOOM, the feeling was gone after the attack subsided and luckily had not returned since. The bad part was that after this third time, I became acutely aware of my breathing and everything that had to do with my heart. I was frantically measuring it and it was always 80-100 following my third attack. This really worried me because I could feel constantly inside that something was wrong either with my breathing or my heart and finally went to see a Doctor. After visiting a primary care physician, he ordered blood work, and EKG and echo. I should note that today we are still not sure whether this is panic or heart issues, or thyroid. It seems as though it's just panic (not just but better than heart issues I suppose). I actually had another attack while I was in the office, it was really bad because I started crying (I'm not one to cry usually), but before that he noticed right away that I had dyspnea and increased heart rate, which I noticed started happening upon entering the hospital. I began to weep when he started to tell me what was wrong with me, the words intensified the panc attack. This was the first time I went to a Doctor, and it seemed that as if for the first time ever I could not control what was happening inside my body, a very bad feeling. The doctor prescribed Xanax 0.5 mg as needed and Zoloft for regular dosing. I'm not taking the Zoloft because. Just because. Happy to say that the Xanax has been a life-saver practically, I am nearly back to my normal self-again and take 0.5 - 1mg as needed, which at this point seems like everyday, not because of panic everyday but because I feel anxiety every day and I'm afraid it will turn into panic if I don't drug it :) I am aware of the terrible withdrawal effects so I started to split .5mg in half and I find it still works well, which is really good because there is a much lower potential for withdrawal at that dosage. I think I will continue to take .25 3x day, exercise & eat healthily and hopefully become stronger and wiser than I was when this is all over.

Truth is I wasn't expecting it and i didn't understand it. Before that episode, i never really understood panic attacks and paid little attention to the term even if i was familiar with it from its popular usage. I had just come out of my dad's room after having a heart-to-heart talk with him when my head started feeling woozy. I thought it was just sleep trying to claim me so i went to bed but i couldn't sleep despite feeling dizzy. My mum was in the room with me so i sat up to tell her i couldn't bring myself to sleep and that was when i noticed that i was feeling de-attached from my body. I had little control over my body movement and i called out to my mum in fear. She panicked and helped take me outside, my legs were wobbly so i kept falling down. I was scared of this whole experience because i had always prided myself on my mental control so I kept asking my mum with tears running down my face,“Mummy, Am i running mad? Am I going to die?” And she'd reply, “God forbid, I reject it. No daughter of mine is going to run mad or die”. I cannot tell why but i really felt like i was going to die and worse; if i didn't die, I'd be mad. Meanwhile, i kept trying to bring myself back together but i couldn't. I was aware of everything happening but i couldn't control it. I was aware of my body making weak movements on its own and yet, i could not control it. I was aware of my brain being unable to conjure coherent thoughts and still, i could not control it. I was aware of everything and scared shitless that i could control none of what was happening. At some point, I was trying to gain control of my mind and body so I'd stand up but that meant that I'd just lose control and fall again. It felt like I was standing at some place and just watching my body misbehave Or like my mind was my own and wasn't my own at the same time (i later learnt that this was called depersonalization). My mum called out to my dad out of fear and he came out, I kept screaming that i wanted to go to the hospital, at least i believe i had some control over my speech because there were some things i made myself say, i remember i kept telling my mum “i love you and please if i do run mad, kill me. Don't let me live like that”. That scared her more. Lol I was taken to the hospital as soon as my dad came out with his car, and when I reached, i kept asking the doctor if i was running mad but he smiled and said i wasn't, he said it was a panic attack and proceeded to inform my parents about it.

I cannot tell why but i really felt like i was going to die and worse; if i didn't die, I'd be mad. Meanwhile, i kept trying to bring myself back together but i couldn't. I was aware of everything happening but i couldn't control it. I was aware of my body making weak movements on its own and yet, i could not control it. I was aware of my brain being unable to conjure coherent thoughts and still, i could not control it. I was aware of everything and scared shitless that i could control none of what was happening. At some point, I was trying to gain control of my mind and body so I'd stand up but that meant that I'd just lose control and fall again. It felt like I was standing at some place and just watching my body misbehave Or like my mind was my own and wasn't my own at the same time (i later learnt that this was called depersonalization). My mum called out to my dad out of fear and he came out, I kept screaming that i wanted to go to the hospital, at least i believe i had some control over my speech because there were some things i made myself say, i remember i kept telling my mum “i love you and please if i do run mad, kill me. Don't let me live like that”. That scared her more. Lol I was taken to the hospital as soon as my dad came out with his car, and when I reached, i kept asking the doctor if i was running mad but he smiled and said i wasn't, he said it was a panic attack and proceeded to inform my parents about it. At some point while i was on the hospital bed, my legs and arms started to shake rapidly and that scared the shit outta me because i knew it was a seizure or something similar to it. But then, my mind was racing to epilepsy.. lol. While this was going on, i kept scaring my mum more by repeating in a shaky and teary voice, “mummy, look. I'm shaking. Do i have epilepsy? What is happening to me??” Immediately, I was injected with sleeping drugs by the nurses and i woke up the next day with a searing headache. My parents stayed with me the whole night and i was later discharged. After dealing with my first episode, i felt it trying to come back the next few days but i read up on it and found out different ways i could control it on my own which i did. Also, my anxiety sort of went to the top after that episode. I had chest aches that would not stop and i could not sleep at night, the doctor prescribed benzodiapines and some other drugs for me which helped. I also met up with a psychologist when i left for school a month later who told me about my subconscious storing up stuff i wasn't aware of. I stopped meeting with him after some time because of the our religious differences and went on to deal with myself by myself. I also had friends around me whom i confided in and they were helpful. Most mornings, I woke up all anxious and confused, I'd call anyone and start crying over the phone for no reason. Lol. But I'm over that now. I believe that the last panic attack that happened is going to be my first and last because the experience isn't something i wanna go through again.\n","Extracted Emotions:\n","admiration: 0.009700504131615162\n","amusement: 0.0029911473393440247\n","anger: 0.01249447837471962\n","annoyance: 0.012373127043247223\n","approval: 0.06658945977687836\n","caring: 0.05015887692570686\n","confusion: 0.16559751331806183\n","curiosity: 0.02526295930147171\n","desire: 0.0440942719578743\n","disappointment: 0.040565524250268936\n","disapproval: 0.023913759738206863\n","disgust: 0.015340329147875309\n","embarrassment: 0.029066767543554306\n","excitement: 0.015053905546665192\n","fear: 0.14564597606658936\n","gratitude: 0.005696107167750597\n","grief: 0.023543212562799454\n","joy: 0.0033713174052536488\n","love: 0.004185263998806477\n","nervousness: 0.10489040613174438\n","optimism: 0.005455951206386089\n","pride: 0.008837338536977768\n","realization: 0.04128429666161537\n","relief: 0.006648194044828415\n","remorse: 0.06271573156118393\n","sadness: 0.0344654880464077\n","surprise: 0.02490752376616001\n","neutral: 0.015150514431297779\n","\n","Text: After my first one, I thought it would never happen again. But it did and it came back with a vengeance.To be completely free, you must accept and embrace death. It is only then that you can be truly alive. -Don Miguel Ruiz - The Four AgreementsI was driving, had to pull over and get out of the car. Considered calling 911 but remembered that it's only a panic attack and I probably will not die. Having walked around the block for about 40 minutes and drunk 2 bottles of cold water, the attack subsided. This might sound crazy, but I thought my food had been laced with drugs the first three times it happened because some of the people I used to associate with are shady and casual drug users, the verdict is still out on that, but at this point I can make an infinite amount of stories about the cause of what happened because I've been exposed to a lot of experiences, some good, some damaging that I would never want to happen again. During the attack, I experienced only the following: very fast & irregular heart rate, (140-160 bpm) which I measured during the attack, slight chills and impending doom and feelings of death resulted from this as well with the former being due to the abnormal heart activity I assume. The strange part was that the first time it happened, it caused me to have a weird feeling in the back of my head on the right that felt like either a part of my brain had been numbed after the attack or there was an object lodged inside my right occipital lobe as well as persistent headaches that eventually went away after about a week or so after treatment with small doses of NSAIDS. The weird occipital lobe feeling did not go away. It seems that this feeling slowly built up and became different, it sort of evolved I would say, into something different after about a month or so, sort of like electric charges this time instead of something static and weird, it felt like electrical energy was pulsating.  This after-effect was the strongest the day I had my second panic attack about 1 month after the first one. The second attack was exactly the same, super-fast irregular heart rate with palpitations following the attack. This attack also lasted about 30 minutes. After the attack I felt a slight relieve in that I knew I had survived, didn't die again -- I was very happy about that, plus that feeling in my head was almost completely gone, it's like it dissipated with the attack. Shortly after however, the feeling of something lodged in my head became even stronger, although not painful, it was a very discomforting feeling (hope I didn't get brain damage). This was also complemented with the electrical charge feeling I described in my first attack. Then in happened again for the third time. The strange part was that after the third time the weird feeling and any feeling in the head dissipated. It seemed almost as if  I had the panic attack at the culmination of the weird head feeling (when it was at its most intense), and then BOOM, the feeling was gone after the attack subsided and luckily had not returned since. The bad part was that after this third time, I became acutely aware of my breathing and everything that had to do with my heart. I was frantically measuring it and it was always 80-100 following my third attack. This really worried me because I could feel constantly inside that something was wrong either with my breathing or my heart and finally went to see a Doctor. After visiting a primary care physician, he ordered blood work, and EKG and echo. I should note that today we are still not sure whether this is panic or heart issues, or thyroid. It seems as though it's just panic (not just but better than heart issues I suppose). I actually had another attack while I was in the office, it was really bad because I started crying (I'm not one to cry usually), but before that he noticed right away that I had dyspnea and increased heart rate, which I noticed started happening upon entering the hospital. I began to weep when he started to tell me what was wrong with me, the words intensified the panc attack. This was the first time I went to a Doctor, and it seemed that as if for the first time ever I could not control what was happening inside my body, a very bad feeling. The doctor prescribed Xanax 0.5 mg as needed and Zoloft for regular dosing. I'm not taking the Zoloft because. Just because. Happy to say that the Xanax has been a life-saver practically, I am nearly back to my normal self-again and take 0.5 - 1mg as needed, which at this point seems like everyday, not because of panic everyday but because I feel anxiety every day and I'm afraid it will turn into panic if I don't drug it :) I am aware of the terrible withdrawal effects so I started to split .5mg in half and I find it still works well, which is really good because there is a much lower potential for withdrawal at that dosage. I think I will continue to take .25 3x day, exercise & eat healthily and hopefully become stronger and wiser than I was when this is all over. Thanks for reading and hope this helps researchers or doctors or people somehow.\n","Extracted Emotions:\n","admiration: 0.012726233340799809\n","amusement: 0.006497458554804325\n","anger: 0.03427182137966156\n","annoyance: 0.023029157891869545\n","approval: 0.10685737431049347\n","caring: 0.07187812030315399\n","confusion: 0.08453764766454697\n","curiosity: 0.05193176120519638\n","desire: 0.05846504494547844\n","disappointment: 0.02020474523305893\n","disapproval: 0.041262976825237274\n","disgust: 0.0188097283244133\n","embarrassment: 0.01950046792626381\n","excitement: 0.04071499779820442\n","fear: 0.03977612033486366\n","gratitude: 0.008803530596196651\n","grief: 0.03843637555837631\n","joy: 0.00920848362147808\n","love: 0.005010125692933798\n","nervousness: 0.02729487419128418\n","optimism: 0.014813773334026337\n","pride: 0.02021104469895363\n","realization: 0.047625064849853516\n","relief: 0.04302884265780449\n","remorse: 0.06585364788770676\n","sadness: 0.028745098039507866\n","surprise: 0.031435392796993256\n","neutral: 0.02907007373869419\n","\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["<ipython-input-47-5c752277fa35>:13: UserWarning: Implicit dimension choice for softmax has been deprecated.
