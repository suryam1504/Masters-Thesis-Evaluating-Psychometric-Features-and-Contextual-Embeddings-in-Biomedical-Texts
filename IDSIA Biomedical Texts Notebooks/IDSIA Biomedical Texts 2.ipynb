In 2008, I was formally diagnosed with GAD and put on Cymbalta (60mg) once a day. Since then, I've been on and off various medications, most good, some not, one horrible experience with Brintellix (or Trintellix as it's marketed here in Canada).\n","\n","Currently I'm on 150mg Wellbutrin XL (brand name) once a day. It's my second go-round with it. The first time (in 2013) it worked well, but I noticed a decline in my kidney function (I'm a transplant recipient) so I took myself off it. Between then and now I was on Effexor (37.5mg) along with Modafinil. \n","\n","I had a massive breakdown October 1st, after about nine months of being without antidepressants at all (with the help of a FANTASTIC counsellor). Woke up, couldn't speak without crying. Had to call off work and I've been off ever since. That day, I went to my doc and asked him to put me back on Wellbutrin. It's been..okay (the brand name is superior to the generic, FYI heh), however, the one thing I noticed that's different between this experience on it and when I was on it last time is that I'm getting headaches from it now that I never got when I was on it previously. They're, quite frankly, scaring the hell out of me. They're not \"Worst Headache Of Life\", but the way my anxiety works is that I can't help but anticipate one that WILL be, and I won't recognize it in time and it'll be too late.

So, I’m 15 years old, male, and about a year ago, my mom played in a soccer game, kids against parents with my younger sister’s team. She hurt her knee or her leg, I can’t remember, and when she got home she was lightheaded and had a mild headache. She was laying on the downstairs couch for most of the day until about 8:00, and it was dark by then. There was no water at the game, and my mom didn’t have any either. So at 8:00 she decides to go to bed, she gets up off of the couch, and starts walking slowly to the stairs. My dad offers to help her up, but she refuses. About halfway up the stairs, she collapses. I was in the room next door, and all of a sudden I hear “EMILY!” (not her real name) yelled from my dad. My siblings and I think it is a joke because my dad is that kind of guy, but when I hear “JOHN (my older brother, also not his real name), CALL 911. MOM IS UNCONCSIOUS”, our hearts dropped. My siblings and I run over to her, and we see my dad putting his finger under her nose, testing if there is a shred of breath, constantly saying her name and wishing for her to wake up, only to see her face grow, shade by shade, increasingly whiter and whiter, dimmer and dimmer. Then, something happened which I was extremely ill-prepared for. My mom starting moaning, and stuck her chin out as far as she could. Then, she started turning her head back, as far as it would go. Her eyes went back, pupils out of sight, and that is when I lost it. I opened my front door, and ran. Ran to the nearest forest, about a mile away, and ran as far as I could into it. It was pouring rain, which made my tears imperceptible. Twenty minutes later, I start walking back to my house, as slowly as I could, and arrived about 45 minutes later. There was an ambulance at my house when I got there, and I could see that they were in my house. I couldn’t walk in there. I couldn’t face it. But I walked to the door, and I braced myself. There my mom was. Alive. Talking to the doctors about what had happened. She spent the night in the hospital and when we visited her the next day, the doctors told us it was because she was dehydrated. Dehydrated. Ps.

Even though, I could internalize them; I wasn't particularly in control of them. The things I like to do when I panic in decreasing order of urgency is:1. Go sit at the beach(if there is one nearby) alone and listen to the sound of waves crashing on the shore. This isn't always possible but very effective in my case.2. I start walking with no particular destination in mind. Sometimes, I even run. The more harsh the weather the better it is because fatigue also brings calm.3. I talk to someone. It can be a complete stranger or a very close friend. I talk to them. Sometimes, I talk about generic things. Other times, I blurt a part of my problem in as generic way as I could and listen quietly to their views. I can do that because I make my best attempt to surround myself with people who are honest and forthcoming with their opinions and are characteristically empathetic. Telling your problem to an egoist or an immature person in general is worse than the problem itself.4. I try my best to do an activity that I do not know at all. And I keep at it no matter how pathetic I am at it. I go swimming, even though I am a bad swimmer or I play a sport I am not familiar with, like squash etc. Panic attacks is all about calming down. Its either in the rhythmic effect of an activity or just simple lack of movement. The only important criteria is to not give up on whatever it is that you are doing to help cope. It doesn't matter how long it takes. That coping mechanism is your best hope.

Like Jordan Yates, I operate normally at a high level of anxiety, so I’m constantly conscious of utilizing learned stress relief. Breathing, walking, playing with my dog, these are great for the day-to-day stuff, but panic attacks are a different ballgame for me entirely. When I get a panic attack, I start shaking. I can taste adrenaline. My vision goes all floaty, and I’ll get sharp chest pains. Often I’ll also get tunnel vision, and become unaware of my surroundings. I become frozen. Any movement hurts, like the world will end if I try to get up and do something. The night after a panic attack, I’m almost never able to sleep. The day after a panic attack, I frequently sleep too much, sore from the muscle contractions and lack of sleep the day before. When the panic gets that bad, the only thing I can do is ride it out. These are moments where focusing on self-care is absolutely critical for me. I’ve found that, even though I can’t talk during a panic attack, I can type or write on my phone. I’ll have conversations with people electronically, and it helps me stay in touch with reality. If my husband and I are at home when this happens, there are two techniques I’ve found very helpful. First, my husband rubs my back softly, in even, large circles. This helps with the muscle tension. Then, I ask him to count out loud, slowly. The noise gives me something to focus on, and the predictability of the intervals and knowing exactly what he’ll say helps calm me down. He feels ridiculous counting, sometimes up into the thousands, but I find it incredibly helpful. Once I’ve calmed to the point where I can move around and talk, I almost always find I need to spend time by myself. I get mean when I’m anxious, and I’m not nice to other people. Other people also tend to make me more anxious, so I don’t calm as easily. If I’m at work, I sneak off to the “mommy room” (a conference room set aside for nursing mothers, that’s equipped with soft lighting and a comfy chair). At home, I’ll lay down in bed or on our amazingly comfortable living room couch. Then it’s Netflix time! The strategy here is to disrupt the thought spirals that are causing the anxiety. I put on a nature show, or a comedy I’m already familiar with, and it distracts from what I call the “demon voices,” basically all the negative thoughts I get caught thinking on a loop like a bad recording. By this point, the panic attack has usually passed, so all I’m dealing with is the pain of the aftermath. Here’s where my usual stress relief techniques come into play. I like getting outside, if possible. I try to take advantage of available “puppy therapy” with my fluffy little scruffmonster. I’ll switch from Netflix to reading a book. I’ll eat a bar of chocolate (JK Rowling hit the nail on the head with that one). Then it’s sleep, resetting, and getting back to business as usual! Thankfully, with the help of a lot of cognitive therapy, and some great drugs prescribed by my psychiatrist, these attacks are becoming less and less frequent. I’m told they’ll never go away entirely, but I can look forward to the day when they’re no longer debilitating. Hopefully that day comes sooner rather than later!\n","Word Embeddings: tensor([[ 0.0335, -0.0520,  0.2906,  ...,  0.0956,  0.3121,  0.6175],\n","        [-0.2357, -0.0189, -0.0584,  ...,  0.1283,  1.1147,  0.2328],\n","        [-0.4404, -0.1465, -0.0136,  ..., -0.2566, -0.1550,  0.4692],\n","        ...,\n","        [ 0.2006, -0.2250,  0.3756,  ..., -0.0915,  0.0061,  0.6812],\n","        [-0.7382,  0.0743, -0.2393,  ...,  0.2062,  0.4539,  0.0860],\n","        [ 0.0403,  0.4659,  0.4359,  ...,  0.8885,  0.0730, -0.2808]])\n","\n","Text: Thankyou so much for your reply back!

I know people without these debilitating illnesses will say I am exaggerating a lot, but believe me I am not! When I stepped into college after my 10th, I started to feel something was not okay within me. I did not know about any of these terminologies then. I used to get tired ( not only physically but mentally ) . I was obsessed about bizarre things and from there I think I developed habit of rumination. I decided to do Engineering in Production without thinking comprehensively. Needless to say, my anxiety rose during those days(2009–13). I struggled to bond with my classmates and was friends with 3–4 guys in the whole batch. I always felt awkward in a crowd of people . Probably I had fear of being judged for no apparent reason. I was only comfortable within a very small group of people. You can imagine how I was with opposite sex! I myself never got involved as I knew about myself! It sucks ! Its been five years since I completed my graduation but my anxiety never seemed to lessen. Currently I am working in an organization struggling with all this. Now I am so stressed and anxious I cannot explain.I feel numb i.e I don’t feel a thing neither good nor bad! At least during my graduation days I lived with my parents. Its very difficult that I am not with them when I need them most. The irony is nobody can do anything in this. Its your own struggle. I don’t know what I am going to do in future. I have plans but I lack energy and motivation. Besides, my illness is making me weaker and weaker each passing day. I tried medication at some point, but it effect was very temporary. If I didn’t have this excruciating pain, I would have been much happy, fun-loving, rational human being as I was a few years ago. But now I feel lost. I request everyone to not judge people. Mental illness is not a joke! It paralyses you from within !\n","Word Embeddings: tensor([[ 0.5245, -0.0553,  0.4406,  ..., -0.2541,  0.3622,  0.0304],\n","        [-0.3997,  0.8021,  0.5399,  ..., -0.2728,  0.1803, -0.2131],\n","        [-0.0261,  0.3239,  0.3224,  ..., -0.4666, -0.1530,  0.4597],\n","        ...,\n","        [-0.1309, -0.0467,  0.0254,  ..., -0.2499, -0.1153, -0.0899],\n","        [ 0.0223,  0.0903,  0.0982,  ..., -0.1881, -0.2950, -0.4687],\n","        [ 0.0693,  0.1824,  0.5310,  ...,  0.0062, -0.2253, -0.5113]])\n","\n","Text: gadamsgrega2 said:\n","\t\t\t\n","\t\t\n","\t\n","\t\n","\t\t\n","\t\t\n","\t\t\tWell first of all the Vitamin B12 is what will key you up...

I didn’t know what was happening and just stood transfixed certain I was going to die. Asked a woman at the station to please drive me across the street as I was afraid I would pass out. She looked at me as if I as crazy, agreed to do it if I waited until she had finished her business buying stamps,etc. By that time I was in a real panic, not knowing what to do, where to turn. When she finally drove me across the street to my cul de sac, I raced to my house, unlocked the door and breathed a sigh of relief because I was safe at last. I spent the rest of the day in bed. Many times after that I would be afraid to go downstairs and into the garage to do the laundry. I wouldn’t get into a car unless my husband was driving and would often lie down on the floor in back because even then I was filled with fear of dying.

Sometimes though they sneak up on us and sometimes nothing we do will head them off. Before telling you some strategies to try, let me give you a “don’t do” up front. If you are legitimately having a “real” panic attack, you’ll feel short of breath and feel like you’re having a heart attack (this is why most panic disorders are diagnosed in the ER because folks genuinely think they’re having a heart attack). If this describes your panic attacks, do NOT do deep belly breathing aka diaphragmatic breathing or progressive muscle relaxation. While these two strategies are great for helping us deal w/ anxiety, they are contraindicated for panic attacks as these will WORSEN the panic attack. So don’t do them! The strategy I’m going to propose to help while you’re in a panic attack is something you can do when “just” feeling anxious as well. Try a mindfulness/grounding technique and/or a sufficiently challenging cognitive distraction. Regarding the latter, take slow measured steps (if able) and with each step recite the alphabet BACKWARDS. If you goof it, start over. If you’d rather not recite the alphabet backwards, then you could choose any number of other things to spell backwards (e.g., title of your favorite book, favorite food, the states you’ve lived in). The former technique (grounding) is simple as well. You’re going to shift your attention to the room that you’re in and identify everything by the color they are (think ROYGBIV). So for instance, slowly scan the room and point out or touch all the things that are red, orange, etc. If someone is with you and helping you, their role is not to point out what you missed but to make sure that you’re truly scanning the room and focusing on the room and not on your panic attack; as long as you get about 80% of the items in the room that are that color, that’s ok, and if you don't then they are to prompt you to more slowly scan the room. Hope that helps.\n","Word Embeddings: tensor([[-0.2019, -0.4407,  0.0284,  ..., -0.1303,  0.1800,  0.7624],\n","        [-0.5534, -0.0136, -0.6884,  ..., -0.0944,  1.0376, -0.2939],\n","        [-0.2314,  0.5301,  0.0286,  ..., -0.5968,  0.8787,  0.3550],\n","        ...,\n","        [ 0.2909,  0.1560,  0.2129,  ...,  0.1332,  0.0869, -0.2326],\n","        [ 0.4415, -0.3551,  0.5970,  ..., -0.0859, -0.0547, -0.4260],\n","        [ 0.3832, -0.2089,  0.5650,  ..., -0.0887, -0.1564, -0.3025]])\n","\n","Text: Everyone feels anxious now and then.

When a doc explains what an attack is they always say a pounding heart, feeling shaky and yes those symptoms do come and they are horrible but you rarely hear about the true nature of the mental side of panic attacks. I think it that side of an attack was spoke about more, there would be a lot less stigma around those feelings and a lot less confusion to sufferers because we all do think we are going crazy when we feel those symptoms because they aren't even spoken about or explained to us. Its easy to see that extra adrenaline causes a pounding heart but you wouldn't think it would cause you to feel spacey, out of yourself etc and that leads to you feeling you're going crazy which only adds to more fear when we should be told that its just excess adrenaline and still a common panic attack symptom and nothing serious.\n","Word Embeddings: tensor([[ 0.2164, -0.1243,  0.2411,  ..., -0.4684,  0.7008,  0.1448],\n","        [ 0.9422, -0.0332,  0.6228,  ..., -0.0594,  0.7164,  0.5417],\n","        [ 0.3871, -0.1569,  0.6987,  ..., -1.1769, -0.4645,  0.1029],\n","        ...,\n","        [ 0.2493,  0.0499,  0.4222,  ..., -0.2335,  0.0013, -0.2162],\n","        [ 0.0627,  0.1877,  0.1650,  ..., -0.2134,  0.1342, -0.4590],\n","        [ 0.1453, -0.1086,  0.6711,  ..., -0.2382, -0.1418, -0.5426]])\n","\n","Text: Anxiety is a complex condition that can be caused by a combination of factors, including genetics, brain chemistry, personality, and life events. It is often associated with stress, which can trigger the release of certain hormones and chemicals in the brain that can lead to feelings of anxiety. Additionally, certain medical conditions, such as thyroid problems or heart disease, can also cause anxiety. It is also possible that past traumatic events may also contribute to the development of anxiety disorders. In any case, it is important to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.Secret Millionaire Bot · January 5Affiliate marketing is a type of performance-based marketing in which a business rewards one or more affiliates for each visitor or customer brought about by the affiliate's own marketing efforts.

Focus on keeping yourself safe: it’s ok if you can’t control it. Step 1: If possible, withdraw. Get to a place away from anything that contributed to the panic attack. The bathroom is pretty good. Step 2: Breathing. I know some people tend to breathe too shallowly, in which case I’d advise counting evenly on your inhales and exhales. If you tend to hyperventilate, breathe out for longer than you breathe in. If stimulation helps, get out your phone and play something repetitive and visually stimulating. If there’s a certain channel or type of meme that calms you, check that out. However, this might not help if you’re worried about being overwhelmed by choices. You can also try naming the colors of things around you- different things work for different people. If your friends are chill, have them draw something on your hand so that when you have an attack you can trace over it with a pen and feel their support. If stimulation doesn’t help, stare at something blank or close your eyes. I wear a hat and sometimes pull it over my eyes to destimulate when that’s what I need to do. Find out what helps and try and do that. One thing that helps with my anxiety is absurdity, so I’ll stick a pencil in my glasses or tiptoe in backwards-facing shoes. However, if laughing is going to make you hyperventilate you probably shouldn’t do that. The bottom line is that all these strategies might work for you or they might actually make things worse. Everyone’s different and different things work for everyone. Usually what works when you’re only a bit anxious will do something in a panic attack, so test things out then to narrow it down. If you see a psychiatrist, you could also consider beta blockers, which prevent you from having a panic attack (physically) for a certain period. There are a lot of factors to consider with beta blockers, and I’m not fond of them myself, but if you think that would be a good desciscion you should discuss it with your psychiatrist.

Anxiety is losing your car keys and worrying about it constantly, until it’s safely in your hands. Anxiety is diving into the ocean. As you're swimming back to the surface, the surface seems so far away and you suddenly feel like you’re being dragged down to the sea bed. Anxiety is the fear of fear.Anxiety is a normal reaction to danger. It is your body’s automatic fight-or-flight response that is triggered when you feel threatened. In moderation, anxiety isn’t necessarily a bad thing; it can help you stay alert and focused, and motivate you to solve problems. However, when the anxiety is constant and overwhelming - when the worries and fears interfere with your relationships and daily life— you’ve likely crossed the line from normal anxiety into an anxiety disorder.Most of our emotion processing takes place in the ancient parts of the brain. Collectively this is called the “limbic system”.The most crucial area of the limbic system is the ‘amygdala’. This plays an important role in the regulation of emotions and forming fear and anxiety-related memories. fMRI studies on Generalized Anxiety Disorder have shown a higher level of activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the area associated with being able to act in a relaxed and natural way. Higher levels of activity is also seen in the amygdala.GAD is described as persistent and excessive worrying. Sometimes just the thought of getting through the day produces anxiety. The symptoms include:Persistent worryingOverthinking plansPerceiving situations as threatening when they are notDifficulty handling uncertaintyFear of making the wrong decisionFeeling restless or on edgeDifficulty concentrating or feeling that your mind has ‘gone blank’The physical symptoms include: fatigue, trouble sleeping, muscle aches, trembling, being startled, nausea, irritable bowel syndrome and irritability.[1]Children and teenagers may have similar worries to adults but also:Feel overly anxious to fit inBe a perfectionistRedo tasks because they aren't perfect the first timeSpend excessive time doing homeworkLack confidenceStrive for approvalRequire a lot of reassurance about performanceHave frequent stomach aches or other physical complaintsAvoid going to school or avoid social situationsFor someone with GAD, the worry cycle feels beyond their control. If you have been experiencing three or more symptoms on more days than not, for at least six months, please see a doctor.Footnotes[1] Generalized anxiety disorder - Symptoms and causes\n","Word Embeddings: tensor([[-0.2538, -0.0959, -0.2771,  ..., -0.5094,  0.1212,  0.4270],\n","        [-0.7015,  0.6031,  0.2862,  ..., -0.4319, -0.1075,  0.1051],\n","        [-0.9164,  0.0232, -0.1091,  ...,  0.4368, -0.3136,  1.2559],\n","        ...,\n","        [-0.4823,  0.3545, -0.3040,  ..., -0.0257, -0.5360, -0.5519],\n","        [ 0.1161,  0.0239, -0.2897,  ..., -0.4508,  0.0622, -0.3330],\n","        [-0.0770, -0.0217,  0.4861,  ...,  0.6401, -0.1311, -0.1682]])\n","\n","Text: I know what you mean there, I'm the same.
